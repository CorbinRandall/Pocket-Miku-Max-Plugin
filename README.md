# 🎤 Pocket Miku Max for Live Controller

A Max for Live MIDI device that lets you control Pocket Miku (NSX-39) in "syllable per key" mode — just like the stylus mode out of the box, but playable from your MIDI keyboard!

Built for creative Vocaloid exploration with Ableton Live.  
Send real-time phoneme (syllable) commands to Miku via MIDI + SysEx.
